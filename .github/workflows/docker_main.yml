name: Main - build image and push
# This workflow builds, tests, and pushes a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry.
# It is triggered on push and manual workflow_dispatch events for the "main" branch.
# The image is tagged with a release version and "latest".
# For pull requests, the Docker image is uploaded as an artifact instead of being pushed to the registry.
# The repository owner is converted to lowercase for consistent tagging.
# The workflow uses the GITHUB_TOKEN secret for authentication with GitHub Container Registry.
# Uncomment the Docker Hub section if you want to push to Docker Hub as well.
# The Docker Hub credentials should be stored in the repository secrets as DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD.

# Jobs:
# - pytest: Runs unit and regression tests using pytest.
# - build_image: Builds the Docker image, tags it, and uploads it as an artifact for PRs.
# - publish_image: Downloads the image artifact and pushes it to GitHub Container Registry (on push events).

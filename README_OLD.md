## Key Features

### **Energy Optimization**
- **Dynamic Energy Flow Control**:
  - Automatically optimizes energy usage based on system states and external data.
  - Supports manual override modes for precise control.
- **Battery Management**:
  - Monitors battery state of charge (SOC) and remaining energy.
  - Configures charging and discharging modes, including:
    - Charge from grid.
    - Avoid discharge.
    - Discharge allowed.
    - EVCC-specific modes (e.g., fast charge, PV mode).
  - **Dynamic Charging Curve with Temperature Protection**:
    - **SOC-based Charging Control**: Automatically adjusts maximum battery charging power based on the current state of charge (SOC). At low SOC (≤50%), charging occurs at maximum configured power (e.g., 1C rate). As SOC increases beyond 50%, charging power is gradually reduced using an exponential curve, reaching minimum power (~5% of configured max) near full capacity. This protects battery health and optimizes charging efficiency.
    - **Temperature-based Protection**: When a battery temperature sensor is configured, the system applies additional power reduction during extreme temperatures to prevent battery damage:
      - **Cold Protection** (<0°C): Reduces charging to 5-7.5% of maximum power to prevent lithium plating in LiFePO4 batteries
      - **Moderate Cold** (0-15°C): Gradually increases allowed charging power as temperature rises
      - **Optimal Range** (15-45°C): No temperature restrictions, full SOC-based curve applies
      - **Heat Protection** (>45°C): Progressively reduces charging power to protect from thermal stress
      - **Critical Heat** (>60°C): Limits charging to 5-7.5% of maximum power
    - The final charging power is the product of both SOC and temperature factors, ensuring comprehensive battery protection.
- **Dynamic Battery Price Calculation**:
  - Analyzes charging history to determine the real cost of energy currently stored in the battery.
  - Uses an **Inventory Valuation (LIFO)** model to ensure the price reflects the most recent charging sessions.
  - Distinguishes between PV surplus and grid charging to provide an accurate cost basis.
  - Helps the optimizer make better decisions about when to discharge the battery based on the actual cost of the stored energy.
- **Cost and Solar Optimization**:
  - Aligns energy usage with real-time electricity prices (e.g., from Tibber, [smartenergy.at](https://www.smartenergy.at/), or [Stromligning.dk](https://stromligning.dk/)) to minimize costs.
  - Incorporates PV forecasts to prioritize charging during periods of high solar output.
  - Reduces grid dependency and maximizes self-consumption by combining cost and solar production data.
- **Energy Optimization Scheduling**:
  - Displays timestamps for the last and next optimization runs.
  - Tracks system performance and optimization results.

### **Interactive Web Interface**
- **Real-Time Monitoring**:
  - View current system states, including battery SOC, grid charge power, and EVCC modes.
  - Dynamic icons and color-coded indicators for easy visualization.
- **User Controls**:
  - Set grid charge power and override system modes directly from the interface.
  - Configure EVCC charging behavior with intuitive controls.

### **Integration with External Systems**
- **Home Assistant**:
  - Full MQTT integration with Home Assistant Auto Discovery (enabled by default via `mqtt.ha_mqtt_auto_discovery`).
  - Automatically detects and configures energy system entities.
- **OpenHAB**:
  - Integrates with OpenHAB for monitoring and controlling energy systems.
  - Publishes system states and subscribes to commands via MQTT.
- **EVCC (Electric Vehicle Charging Controller)**:
  - Monitors and controls EVCC charging modes and states.
  - Supports fast charge, PV charging, and combined modes.
- **Inverter Interfaces**:
  - OPTION 1: Communicates directly with a Fronius GEN24 to monitor and control energy flows.
    - `fronius_gen24`: Enhanced interface with firmware-based authentication for all firmware versions
    - `fronius_gen24_legacy`: Legacy interface for corner cases or troubleshooting
  - OPTION 2: Use the [evcc external battery control](https://docs.evcc.io/docs/integrations/rest-api) to interact with all inverter/ battery systems that [are supported by evcc](https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/devices/meters) (hint: the dynamic max charge power is currently not supported by evcc external battery control)
  - OPTION 3: using without a direct control interface to get the resulting commands by **EOS connect** MQTT or web API to control within your own environment (e.g. [Integrate inverter e.g. sungrow SH10RT #35](https://github.com/rockinglama/eos-ha/discussions/35)  )
  - Retrieves real-time data such as grid charge power, discharge power, and battery SOC.
- **MQTT Broker**:
  - Acts as the central hub for real-time data exchange.
  - Publishes system states and subscribes to control commands.

## Current Status

This project is in its early stages and is actively being developed and enhanced.

2025-04-10

- EOS made a breaking change - see here https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS/discussions/513
- there were also changes in the API at '<your_ip>:8503' - unfortunately the API is not versioned (*ping* ;-) )
- to fullfil both versions there is small hack to identify the connected EOS
- finally the current version can run with both EOS versions

2025-09-06

- Added **Enhanced Fronius GEN24 Interface** (`fronius_gen24`) with intelligent authentication support:
  - ✅ **Automatic Firmware Detection**: Detects firmware version and selects optimal authentication method
  - ✅ **Universal Compatibility**: Works with all firmware versions (< 1.36.5-1, 1.36.5-1 to 1.38.5-x, ≥ 1.38.6-1)
  - ✅ **Smart Authentication**: MD5 for older firmware, SHA256 with MD5 fallback for newest firmware  
  - ✅ **Optimized Performance**: Reduces authentication overhead by using firmware-appropriate methods
  - ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Clear troubleshooting guidance for authentication issues
  - ✅ **100% Backward Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for previous interface
  - **Recommended**: Default interface for all Fronius GEN24 installations
  - **Legacy Fallback**: Use `fronius_gen24_legacy` for corner cases if needed

## Quick Start

Get up and running with EOS HA in just a few steps!

### 1. Requirements

- **Home Assistant** (recommended for most users)  
  *(Or see [Installation and Running](#installation-and-running) for Docker and local options)*
- **An already running instance of [EOS (Energy Optimization System)](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS)**  
  EOS HA acts as a client and requires a reachable EOS server for optimization and control. (Or use the EOS HA addon mentioned in next step.)
- **Properly configured EOS for prediction** (see [EOS Configuration Requirements](#eos-configuration-requirements) below)

### 2. Install via Home Assistant Add-on

- Add the [rockinglama/ha_addons](https://github.com/rockinglama/ha_addons) repository to your Home Assistant add-on store.
- select your preferred optimization backend:
  - [if needed] Add the [Duetting/ha_eos_addon](https://github.com/Duetting/ha_eos_addon) (or [thecem/ha_eos_addon](https://github.com/thecem/ha_eos_addon)) repository to your Home Assistant add-on store.
  - [if needed] Install [EVopt](https://github.com/thecem/hassio-evopt) (Lightweight alternative).
- Install both the **EOS Add-on** (or **EVopt**) and the **EOS HA Add-on**. 
- Configure both add-ons via the Home Assistant UI.
- Start both add-ons.  
  The EOS HA web dashboard will be available at [http://homeassistant.local:8081](http://homeassistant.local:8081) (or your HA IP).

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fohand%2Fha_addons)

### 3. Configure

- On first start, a default `config.yaml` will be created in the add-on’s config folder.
- Edit this file via the Home Assistant add-on UI to set your EOS server address, `time_frame`, and other options.
- See the [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md) for full configuration details, including the new `time_frame` setting for 15-minute or hourly cycles.

### 4. Explore

- Open the web dashboard at [http://homeassistant.local:8081](http://homeassistant.local:8081) (or your HA IP).
- Check live data, forecasts, and system status.
- Integrate with your automation tools using the [Web API](#web-api-restjson) or [MQTT](#mqtt---provided-data-and-possible-commands).

---

## EOS Configuration Requirements

**Important**: EOS HA requires specific prediction settings in your EOS instance. The default EOS configuration should work out-of-the-box, but verify these settings if you experience issues with forecasting.

### Required EOS Prediction Settings

In your EOS `config.yml`, ensure these prediction parameters are configured:

```yaml
# EOS config.yml - Prediction and Optimization settings
prediction:
  # Prediction horizon (default: 48 hours)
  # EOS HA requires at least 48 hours for proper optimization
  hours_ahead: 48
  
optimization:
  # Optimization horizon (default: 48 hours) 
  # Should match or be <= prediction hours_ahead
  hours_ahead: 48
```

### What EOS HA Handles

- **Optimization Requests**: EOS HA sends optimization requests to EOS on a configurable interval (e.g., every 3 minutes)
- **No EOS Internal Scheduling**: EOS HA manages all timing - no internal EOS optimization intervals are used
- **48-Hour Forecasting**: EOS HA provides 48-hour load and PV forecasts to EOS for optimal decision making

### Troubleshooting

- **Short/No predictions**: Verify `prediction.hours_ahead: 48` in EOS config
- **Optimization errors**: Ensure `optimization.hours_ahead` is set to 48 or less than prediction horizon
- **EOS HA timing**: All optimization scheduling is handled by EOS HA, not EOS internal timers

The default EOS configuration typically includes these 48-hour settings. If you've customized your EOS config, ensure these values are properly set.

For detailed EOS configuration, refer to the [EOS documentation](https://github.com/Akkudoktor-EOS/EOS#configuration).

## How it Works

### Base

**EOS HA** is a self-running system that periodically collects:
- Local energy consumption data.
- PV solar forecasts for the next 48 hours.
- Upcoming energy prices.

Using this data, a request is sent to EOS, which creates a model predicting the energy needs based on different energy sources and loads (grid, battery, PV).

**EOS HA** waits for the response from EOS (e.g., ~2 min 15 sec for a full 48-hour prediction on a Raspberry Pi 5). After receiving the response, it is analyzed to extract the necessary values.

Finally, the system sets up the inverter based on the following states:
- `MODE_CHARGE_FROM_GRID` with a specific target charging power (based on your configuration).
- `MODE_AVOID_DISCHARGE`.
- `MODE_DISCHARGE_ALLOWED` with a specific target maximum discharging power (based on your configuration).

The system repeats this process periodically, e.g., every 3 minutes, as defined in the configuration.

### Collecting Data

Data collection for load forecasting is based on your existing load data provided by an OpenHAB or Home Assistant instance (using the persistence of each system). EOS requires a load forecast for today and tomorrow.

#### Home Assistant
Load data is retrieved from:
- Today one week ago, averaged with today two weeks ago.
- Tomorrow one week ago, averaged with tomorrow two weeks ago.
- **Car Load Adjustment**: If an electric vehicle (EV) is/ was connected, its load is subtracted from the household load to ensure accurate forecasting of non-EV energy consumption.

**Load Sensor Requirements:**
- **Data Quality**: The sensor must provide numeric values and in unit 'watts'.
- **Value Handling**: EOS HA accepts both positive and negative values from your sensor. For the internal processing: all values are converted to absolute positive values for load calculations.
- **Sensor Types**: Use sensors representing the overall net household consumption. Expected that all additonal loads as ev charge or an optional load are included here.

(See [Home Assistant Persistance](#home-assistant-persistance) for more details.)

#### OpenHAB
Load data is retrieved from the last two days:
- From two days ago (00:00) to yesterday midnight.
- **Car Load Adjustment**: Similar to Home Assistant, the EV load is subtracted from the household load to isolate non-EV energy consumption.

#### PV Forecast
EOS HA supports multiple sources for solar (PV) production forecasts. You can choose the provider that best fits your location and needs. The following PV forecast sources are available and configurable:

- **Akkudoktor** (default)  
  Direct integration with the [Akkudoktor API](https://api.akkudoktor.net/forecast) for reliable PV forecasts.

- **Open-Meteo**  
  Uses the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) and [open-meteo-solar-forecast Python library](https://github.com/rany2/open-meteo-solar-forecast) for library-based calculation

- **Open-Meteo Local**  
  Gathers radiation and cloud cover data from Open-Meteo and calculates PV output locally using an own model (experimental).

- **Forecast.Solar**  
  Connects to the [Forecast.Solar API](https://doc.forecast.solar/api) for detailed PV production forecasts.

- **Solcast**  
  Integrates with the [Solcast API](https://solcast.com/) for high-precision solar forecasting using satellite data and machine learning models. Requires creating a rooftop site in your Solcast account and using the resource ID (not location coordinates). Free Solcast API key provides up to 10 API calls per day. **Note: EOS HA automatically uses extended update intervals (2.5 hours) when Solcast is selected to stay within rate limits.**

- **EVCC**  
  Retrieves PV forecasts directly from an existing [EVCC](https://evcc.io/) installation via its API. This option leverages EVCC's built-in solar forecast capabilities, including its automatic scaling feature that adjusts forecasts based on your actual historical PV production data for improved accuracy.

#### Energy Price Forecast
Energy price forecasts are retrieved from the chosen source (e.g. tibber, Akkudoktor, Smartenergy, ...). **Note**: Prices for tomorrow are available earliest at 1 PM. Until then, today's prices are used to feed the model.

#### Battery Price Analysis (Inventory Valuation)
EOS HA calculates the actual cost of the energy currently stored in your battery by analyzing your recent charging history. Instead of a simple average, it uses an **Inventory Valuation (LIFO)** model:
- **Smart Tracking**: It automatically identifies if energy came from your solar panels (0€) or the grid.
- **Inventory Focus**: It calculates the price based on the most recent charging sessions that match your current battery level. This means the price reflects the "value" of the energy actually inside the battery.
- **Live Pricing**: For grid charging, it uses the exact electricity price at that time.
- **Visual Feedback**: The dashboard highlights which charging sessions are currently "in inventory" and which are historical.

> **Note:**  
> All data collection, forecasting, and optimization cycles are now driven by the `time_frame` setting in your configuration.  
> For more precise and responsive optimization, set `time_frame: 900` for a 15-minute cycle.

**Important Notes:**
- **`current_discharge_allowed`**: This field reflects the **final effective state** after all overrides (EVCC modes, manual overrides) are applied. For example:
  - When EVCC is charging in PV mode (`"inverter_mode": "MODE DISCHARGE ALLOWED EVCC PV"`), `current_discharge_allowed` will be `true` even if the optimizer originally suggested avoiding discharge
  - This ensures consistency between the mode and discharge state for integrations like Home Assistant
- **Inverter modes**:
  - `0` = MODE CHARGE FROM GRID
  - `1` = MODE AVOID DISCHARGE
  - `2` = MODE DISCHARGE ALLOWED
  - `3` = MODE AVOID DISCHARGE EVCC FAST (fast charging)
  - `4` = MODE DISCHARGE ALLOWED EVCC PV (EV charging in PV mode)
  - `5` = MODE DISCHARGE ALLOWED EVCC MIN+PV (EV charging in Min+PV mode)
  - `6` = MODE CHARGE FROM GRID EVCC FAST (grid charging during fast EV charge)

**How to Use:**
- **Get current system state:**  
  `GET http://localhost:8081/json/current_controls.json`
- **Override mode and charge power:**  
  `POST http://localhost:8081/controls/mode_override`  
  with JSON body as shown above.
- **Monitor application logs:**  
  `GET http://localhost:8081/logs?level=ERROR&limit=20`
- **Get system alerts:**  
  `GET http://localhost:8081/logs/alerts`
- **Get log buffer statistics:**  
  `GET http://localhost:8081/logs/stats`
- **Clear memory logs:**  
  `POST http://localhost:8081/logs/clear`
- **Clear only alerts:**  
  `POST http://localhost:8081/logs/alerts/clear`

You can use `curl`, Postman, or any HTTP client to interact with these endpoints.

**Examples using curl:**
```bash
# Get last 10 error logs
curl "http://localhost:8081/logs?level=ERROR&limit=10"

# Get current system alerts
curl "http://localhost:8081/logs/alerts"

# Get log buffer usage statistics
curl "http://localhost:8081/logs/stats"

# Clear all memory logs
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/logs/clear"

# Clear only alert logs
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/logs/alerts/clear"

# Override system mode
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/controls/mode_override" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mode": 1, "duration": "02:00", "grid_charge_power": 2.0}'
```

**Memory Log System Notes:**
- **Main buffer**: Stores the last 5000 log entries (all levels mixed)
- **Alert buffer**: Stores the last 2000 alert entries (WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL only)
- **Persistent storage**: File-based logs are not affected by memory operations
- **Timezone aware**: All timestamps use the configured timezone
- **Thread-safe**: Safe for concurrent access from multiple clients
- **Performance**: Memory-based access provides fast response times
- **Monitoring**: Use `/logs/stats` to monitor buffer usage and plan capacity

The logging API enables real-time monitoring, alerting systems, and debugging without affecting the persistent file-based logging system.

### MQTT - provided data and possible commands

EOS HA publishes a wide range of real-time system data and control states to MQTT topics. You can use these topics to monitor system status, battery and inverter data, optimization results, and more from any MQTT-compatible tool (e.g., Home Assistant, Node-RED, Grafana, etc.).

<details>
<summary>MQTT Data Published</summary>

**Base topic:**  
`<mqtt_configured_prefix>/eos_ha/`  
*(Set `<mqtt_configured_prefix>` in your `config.yaml`, e.g., `myhome`)*

#### Example Usage

- **Monitor battery SOC in Home Assistant:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_ha/battery/soc` to get real-time battery state of charge.
- **Track optimization runs:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_ha/optimization/last_run` and `myhome/eos_ha/optimization/next_run` for scheduling info.
- **Visualize inverter temperatures:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_ha/inverter/special/temperature_inverter` (if Fronius V1/V2 inverter is connected).
- **Check if override is active:**
  - Subscribe to `myhome/eos_ha/control/override_active`.

You can use any MQTT client, automation platform, or dashboard tool to subscribe to these topics and visualize or process the data as needed.

---

**Notes:**
- The `<mqtt_configured_prefix>` is set in your configuration file (see `config.yaml`).
- Some topics (e.g., inverter special values) are only published if the corresponding hardware is present and enabled.
- All topics are published with real-time updates as soon as new data is available.
- **State Consistency**: The `control/eos_discharge_allowed` topic reflects the **final effective state** after combining optimizer output, EVCC overrides, and manual overrides. This ensures that all outputs (MQTT, Web API, inverter commands) consistently represent eos-ha's final decision.

EOS HA can be remotely controlled via MQTT by publishing messages to specific topics. This allows you to change system modes, set override durations, and adjust grid charge power from external tools such as Home Assistant, Node-RED, or any MQTT client.
</br></br>
<details>
<summary>MQTT Data Subscribed</summary>



**Base topic:**  
`<mqtt_configured_prefix>/eos_ha/`  
*(Set `<mqtt_configured_prefix>` in your `config.yaml`, e.g., `myhome`)*

---

### Subscribed Topics

| Topic Suffix                        | Full Topic Example                                     | Expected Payload         | Description / Effect                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `control/overall_state/set`         | `myhome/eos_ha/control/overall_state/set`         | Integer or string (mode) | Changes the system mode (see table below)          |
| `control/override_remain_time/set`  | `myhome/eos_ha/control/override_remain_time/set`  | String `"HH:MM"`         | Sets the override duration (e.g., `"02:00"`)       |
| `control/override_charge_power/set` | `myhome/eos_ha/control/override_charge_power/set` | Integer (watts)          | Sets the override grid charge power (e.g., `2000`) |

---

### System Mode Control (`control/overall_state/set`)

You can set the system mode by publishing either the **mode name** (string) or the **mode number** (integer).  
**Only the following user-settable values are accepted:**

| Mode Name             | Mode Number | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Auto`                | -2          | Fully automatic optimization (default mode) |
| `Charge from Grid`    | 0           | Force battery charging from the grid        |
| `Avoid Discharge`     | 1           | Prevent battery discharge                   |
| `Discharge Allowed`   | 2           | Allow battery discharge                     |

**Note:** Additional modes (3-6) exist for EVCC integration but are automatically set by the system and cannot be manually selected. If you try to select an EVCC mode via MQTT, it will revert to Auto (-2).

---

### How to Use

- **Publish a message** to the desired topic with the correct payload.
- The system will immediately process the command and update its state.
- You can use any MQTT client, automation platform, or script.

#### Examples

- **Set system mode to "Auto":**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_ha/control/overall_state/set" -m "Auto"
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_ha/control/overall_state/set" -m "-2"
  ```

- **Force battery charging from grid:**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_ha/control/overall_state/set" -m "Charge from Grid"
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_ha/control/overall_state/set" -m "0"
  ```

- **Set override duration to 1 hour 30 minutes:**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_ha/control/override_remain_time/set" -m "01:30"
  ```

- **Set override grid charge power to 1500 W:**
  ```bash
  mosquitto_pub -t "myhome/eos_ha/control/override_charge_power/set" -m "1500"
  ```

---

**Notes:**
- The `<mqtt_configured_prefix>` is set in your configuration file (see `config.yaml`).
- Payloads must match the expected format for each topic.
- Any value other than those listed for system mode will be ignored or rejected.
- These topics allow you to remotely control and override the energy management system in real time.

## Configuration

With the first start of **EOS connect** a default `config.yaml` will be generated in the `\src` folder. For full documentation for the different entries go to [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md)

*Note: With the default config and a valid EOS server IP/DNS name entry ('eos -> server') - **EOS connect** should be running out of the box with some static defaults as a start point for a step-by-step commissioning.*

#### New: Optimization Time Frame

EOS HA now supports both hourly (legacy) and 15-minute (quarterly) optimization cycles for all forecasts and control flows.  
Set the new `time_frame` entry in your `config.yaml` to control the interval:

```yaml
time_frame: 900   # 15-minute cycle (recommended for more precise optimization)
# or
time_frame: 3600  # hourly cycle (legacy mode, default if not set)
```

- All forecasts, optimization requests, and control cycles will use this interval.
- For higher precision and more frequent updates, use `900` (15 minutes).
- For legacy hourly operation, use `3600`.

See [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md) for full details.

## Useful Information

### Getting historical values

#### Home Assistant Persistance

The tool will use historical data from Home Assistant's local database. By default, this database is configured with a retention period of **10 days**.

To improve the accuracy of load forecasts, it is recommended to use data from the last **2 weeks**. 

You can extend the retention period by modifying the `recorder` configuration in Home Assistant's `configuration.yaml` file. If the `recorder` section is not already present, you can add it as shown below:

```yaml
recorder:
  purge_keep_days: 15  # Keep data for 15 days
```

After making this change, restart Home Assistant for the new retention period to take effect.

**Note**: Increasing the retention period will require more storage space, depending on the number of entities being recorded.

If you do not change the retention period, the tool will still work, but it will use the available 10 days of data, which may result in less accurate load forecasts.

#### Openhab

No specific info yet.

## Usage

The application will start fetching energy data from OpenHAB or HomeAssistant and processing it. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8081`. For local usage the port is configurable see [CONFIG_README](src/CONFIG_README.md). For docker usage change the mapped port in docker-compose.yml.

Hotfix
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c hotfix/overrun-calc
...fix...
PR → main, tag release, then: git switch develop && git merge --ff-only main

Guidelines
- One logical change per PR
- Add/adjust tests for logic changes
  - Use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for all unit and integration tests.
  - Place tests in the `tests/` directory, organized to mirror the structure of the `src/` directory:
    - Create a subfolder for each source module or feature (e.g., if your code is in `src/interfaces/mqtt_interface.py`, place tests in `tests/interfaces/test_mqtt_interface.py`).
    - Name test files as `test_<uut-filename>.py` (e.g., `test_mqtt_interface.py` for `mqtt_interface.py`).
- Document new config keys / API / MQTT topics
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
